   - **OpenAPI Standard**: Comprehensive documentation for RESTful APIs.
   - **Django REST Framework**: Supports CRUD operations for users dwindles properties.
   - **GraphQL**: Flexible querying for efficient data retrieval.
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Endpoints: `GET /users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
   - Features: Register, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. **Property Management**:
   - Endpoints: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
   - Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. **Booking System**:
   - Endpoints: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
   - Features: Manage reservations, including check-in/check-out details.
5. **Payment Processing**:
   - Endpoints: `/payments/`
   - Features: Process and record booking-related transactions.
6. **Review System**:
   - Endpoints: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
   - Features: Post and manage property reviews and ratings.
7. **Database Optimizations**:
   - **Indexing**: Fast retrieval for frequently accessed data.
   - **Caching**: Redis-based caching to reduce database load.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: High-level Python framework for RESTful API development.
- **Django REST Framework**: Tools for building and managing APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for robust data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query language for efficient data access.
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task handling for notifications and payments.
- **Redis**: Caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment workflows.

## API Documentation
- **REST API**: Documented using OpenAPI standard for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible query interface for data retrieval and manipulation.

  - Designs and implements RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints for user, property, booking, payment, and review functionalities.
  - Writes clean, maintainable code in Django, integrating business logic and ensuring scalability.
  - Collaborates with frontend developers for seamless API integration.

- **Database Administrator**:
  - Designs and optimizes the PostgreSQL database schema to support complex relationships (e.g., users, properties, bookings).
  - Implements indexing and query optimizations for efficient data retrieval.
  - Manages database backups, security, and performance monitoring.

- **DevOps Engineer**:
  - Configures Docker containers for consistent development and production environments.
  - Sets up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of code changes.
  - Monitors system performance, scalability, and security in production.

- **QA Engineer**:
  - Develops and executes test plans to validate API functionality, performance, and security.
  - Performs manual and automated testing using tools like Postman and pytest.
  - Ensures the backend meets quality standards and user requirements before release.

  - Ensures the backend meets quality standards and user requirements before release.

## Database Design
The AirBnB Clone Project uses a PostgreSQL relational database to manage core entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and their relationships.

### Entities and Fields
- **Users**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `email`: User’s email address (unique, required).
  - `password_hash`: Securely hashed password.
  - `name`: Full name of the user.
  - `role`: User type (e.g., guest, host, admin).
  
- **Properties**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `title`: Property name or headline (e.g., “Cozy Apartment”).
  - `description`: Detailed property description.
  - `price_per_night`: Cost per night (decimal).
  - `owner_id`: Foreign Key referencing Users(id).

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `property_id`: Foreign Key referencing Properties(id).
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key referencing Users(id).
  - `check_in_date`: Start date of booking.
  - `check_out_date`: End date of booking.

- **Reviews**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `property_id`: Foreign Key referencing Properties(id).
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key referencing Users(id).
  - `rating`: Numerical rating (1–5).
  - `comment`: Text review of the property.

- **Payments**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `booking_id`: Foreign Key referencing Bookings(id).
  - `amount`: Payment amount (decimal).
  - `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed).
  - `transaction_id`: Unique identifier from payment processor.

### Relationships
- **Users and Properties**: A User (host) can own multiple Properties (one-to-many). The `owner_id` in Properties links to Users(id).
- **Properties and Bookings**: A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many). The `property_id` in Bookings links to Properties(id).
- **Users and Bookings**: A User (guest) can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many). The `user_id` in Bookings links to Users(id).
- **Properties and Reviews**: A Property can have multiple Reviews (one-to-many). The `property_id` in Reviews links to Properties(id).
- **Users and Reviews**: A User can write multiple Reviews (one-to-many). The `user_id` in Reviews links to Users(id).
- **Bookings and Payments**: A Booking has one Payment (one-to-one). The `booking_id` in Payments links to Bookings(id).

## API Documentation
